1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
    Mobile data usage is a concern, and most users would like not to load unnecessary data.

2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a
device with 320 x 568 resolution?
    Nothing, because the conditions calls for the width of the device to be between 768px and 1024px. The width of the this device is 320px.

3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of
dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
    Not needing to redirect the users if they access the unoptimized version for their device. 
    They still look good for devices that don't follow the standards.
